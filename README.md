# [Tutorial] Catlike Coding - Rendering
A repository of [Catlike Coding's rendering tutorial series](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/ "Catlike Coding's basics rendering series"); 15/20 parts completed July 2019.

*Last compiled with Unity version 2019.4.40f1.*

## Project Description

This tutorial series covers basic and advanced computer rendering. Many features that are already performed by the Unity engine are reimplemented for demonstration and foundational knowledge.

The completed parts of the series cover:
* Matrices
* Camera Projections
* Shaders
* Mipmapping
* Texture splatting
* Lighting (Multiple, cookies, spherical harmonics)
* Blinn-Phong to Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)
* Shadows
* Reflections (Cubemaps)
* Compex materials (Metallic, smoothness, emission, occlusion)
* Transparency
* Transparency Shadows
* Deferred Shading
* Fog
* Deferred Lighting
* Custom unity inspector GUI

## Controls

This tutorial series has multiple scenes which can be viewed in the editor in play-mode. Some scenes may require you to wait for lighting to be baked after loading before entering play-mode to see the full effects.

As this is a rendering tutorial series there is no interactivity.
